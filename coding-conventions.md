coding conventions

__all codes:__
- prefer 'pythonic', so:
    - 4 spaces
    - wrap at 80 columns (but here it's not mandatory)

__html:__
- 2 blank lines between sections
- focus on proper indentation. (even though html doesn't require indentation to refer to blocks)

__scss/sass:__
- 1 blank line to separate mixins and extends inside selector blocks
- 2 blank lines between variables blocks
- 2 blank lines between selectors
- 3 blank lines above and below functions/mixins
